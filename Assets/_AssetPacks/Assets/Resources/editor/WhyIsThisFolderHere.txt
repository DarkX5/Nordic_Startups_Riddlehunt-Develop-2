Hi Friend,

this folder (Resources/editor) contains assets that need to be loaded at "test-time".

the resource folder is normally built INTO the deployment of an application, but the editor folder STRIPS these assets from the build.

The assets located here are intended for use with the TESTS in the EDITOR.
